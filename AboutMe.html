	<h1><b>ABOUT ME YOOOO</b></h1>

	<p>
		Recently graduating with a Masters in Physics from the University of Liverpool, and after a year on
		a particle physics PhD programme, I am ready to enter in to a career outside of academia. During
		my time in the PhD programme I gained great experience and new skills, which I believe would
		be vital to any career. I am a very driven person with a highly analytical mind and a passion for
		learning new skills and working with others, and believe I would make a great addition to any team.
